Title: Dreams and Nightmares

Overview: This feature would add a new dimension to the Sims’ sleep experience, by introducing dreams and nightmares that can affect their mood, skills, relationships, and aspirations. Dreams and nightmares would be influenced by the Sims’ traits, emotions, needs, and life events, and would have different outcomes depending on how the Sims react to them.

Value statement: This feature would enhance the realism and immersion of the game, by adding more depth and variety to the Sims’ personalities and stories. It would also create new gameplay opportunities and challenges, by giving the players more control over the Sims’ subconscious and its effects on their waking life. Additionally, it would complement and expand the existing game mechanics of sleep, mood, aspiration, and whims.

Solution: This feature would integrate with the existing game mechanics as follows:

When a Sim goes to sleep, they have a chance of having a dream or a nightmare, depending on their traits, emotions, needs, and life events. For example, a Sim with the Creative trait might have more dreams than a Sim with the Lazy trait, a Sim who is Happy might have more pleasant dreams than a Sim who is Angry, a Sim who is Hungry might have dreams about food, and a Sim who has recently experienced a breakup might have nightmares about their ex.
The dreams and nightmares would be represented by a pop-up window that shows a brief description and an image of the dream or nightmare, similar to the opportunity window. The player can choose to ignore the pop-up, or click on it to see more details and options.
The details and options would vary depending on the type and content of the dream or nightmare. For example, a dream about flying might give the option to either enjoy the flight or try to land, a nightmare about being chased might give the option to either run away or confront the pursuer, and a dream about a romantic interest might give the option to either kiss them or reject them.
The choices made by the player would affect the outcome of the dream or nightmare, and its impact on the Sim’s mood, skills, relationships, and aspirations. For example, choosing to enjoy the flight might give the Sim a Happy moodlet and a boost to their Creativity skill, choosing to run away might give the Sim a Scared moodlet and a penalty to their Confidence skill, and choosing to kiss the romantic interest might give the Sim a Flirty moodlet and a boost to their relationship with that Sim.
The dreams and nightmares would also have a chance of triggering whims, aspirations, or events related to the dream or nightmare. For example, a dream about flying might trigger a whim to buy a drone, a nightmare about being chased might trigger an aspiration to become a detective, and a dream about a romantic interest might trigger an event where the Sim meets that Sim in real life.
